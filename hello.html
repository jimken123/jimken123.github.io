## Hello

My main connection point to the web is always [/manana manana](https://mananamanana.com).

My main social media these days is [/mastodon](https://mas.to/@jimkennedy).

My kids are more interesting than me; you can follow their monkeyness on [/ohpiglet](https://ohpiglet.github.io/ohpiglet/).

You can also drop me an [/email](mailto:jimken123@gmail.com).

I build my websites on [/github](https://github.com/jimken123).

I have an rss as well, apparently, at [/feed](https://mananamanana.com/feed.xml).

More about me on the [/about](https://mananamanana.com/about) page.

More about what I'm doing now on the [/now](https://mananamanana.com/now) page.

### Yeah, but no

I exist on /LinkedIn but only when I'm actively looking for a job.

I exist on /Facebook against my better judgement and only for /klf sightings.

I left /twitter ages back.
