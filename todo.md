## From Rebecca

Contact lenses
Tolstoy book
Writing
Llavorsí
The woman from the supermarket
Queen on the plaza
Error as a parenting strategy
Error as a partnering strategy
Duelling short stories
I am a cliché
Bag of courgettes
The mountain spring
Transitions
Desire
Take away the elements of non importance
How would you write it
I have written nothing for 52 years
Dynamite the tunnel
Aggressive impulses.
Clean the kitchen
Feelings are what you feel
Use glasses
Don't use glasses
What would Rebecca do
What would Saoirse do
Waterfalls
Writing as engineering
Economy of family
Do we need doors
Psychology of small animals
Psychology of small children
Psychology of insects
Insecurity
Resistance
Remember winter
Assemble the children
Just work
The centre is outside
Baby steps
Post orgasmic tickles
Fold down the pages
Listen in the garden
Would anybody read it
I am the rhythm, I am the beat
Critical velocity
Unpaid On call
The gaps between thoughts
Why not
Orange is a sound
The hairdresser who now works in the supermarket is a hypochondriac
The meditation bench beside the vegetation patch
The river runs low
