## This is what I was doing then

These are the things from the past, a foreign country.

[/twitter](https://tweet-archive.github.io/twitter/) - I was on twitter from 2008 to 2022, and now I'm no longer there because, well, you know. This is a backup archive of my account.

[/mananamanana blog](https://mananamanana.wordpress.com) - from 2008 to 2011 I ran the MananaManana blog, and it's still up there on WordPress.

[/grand canyon](https://mananamanana.com/grandcanyon/) in 2009 we did a two-week, self-supported oar raft trip on the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. This is the photo gallery from that epic adventure.

[/dublinopinion blog](https://dublinopinion.mananamanana.com/) - I was a contributor to the wide-ranging Dublin Opinion blog from 2006 to 2010, talking mostly about gigs and music. I retrieved my content from the wayback machine.

[/scotland trip reports](https://mananamanana.com/scotland) - the bigger kayaking trips we went on from 2004 to 2007 are documented in these trip reports. All foreign kayaking trips are to Scotland, or some variant of that sceptered land. In 2006 I wrote an article on the Scotland '04 trip to Latin America for Outsider magazine. It's entitled [/Indecision - The Key to Flexibility](/outsider).

[/herbert park rangers fc](https://hprfc.mananamanana.com/) - I commentated on Herbert Park Rangers FC, our hours-long football games in Dublin's lovely Herbert Park. This was my first website, on Geocities, now retrieved from the wayback machine.
