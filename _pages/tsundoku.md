## Tsundoku

The Japanese concept of *tsundoku* is the phenomeneon of acquiring books but letting them pile up without reading them. It's a portmanteau of two Japanese words meaning "to pile things up ready for later and leave" and "reading books."

The term is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf. In the West it has a negative connotation of a hoarding mania with no realistic expectation of getting around to reading the books.

I'm choosing to use the more optimistic interpretation of "books are good, there's no such thing as too many" and "I'm definitely more likely to read them if I have them on my bookshelf."

### Books, books, books

This is what I'm reading at the moment, have piled up to read in the future, or have read in the recent past. I started tracking my books in 2024 sometime. 

#### Memòria distant - Colm Tóibín

The ever-prolific Senyor Tóibín returns with a collection of essays, on the idea of 'distant memories' focussed around his early life in Wexford. He gave a well-attended talk on this in the village of Farrera, just up the road.

#### The Pearl - John Steinbeck

Rereading this classic after so many decades that I couldn't even remember the plot. My favourite Steinbeck remains Travels with Charley, but I must also reread The Grapes of Wrath.

#### Mrs. Dalloway - Virginia Woolf

The summer of feminist reading continues. What a revelation this book is! How am I only now reading Woolf? A book to savour and read around, and to read again.

#### Left Hand of Darkness - Ursula Le Guin

Finally plugging the gap, both in my women writers' list and in the science fiction genre.

#### Listen to the Land Speak - Manchán Magan

A wandering philosophy wrapped around the old Irish mythology and ancient places.

#### Dones més enllà de les armes - Various authors

This is a transcript collection of verbal accounts given by various women who have been involved in armed struggles around the world. I picked it up at the library in Sort, having joined the library just to do that. I haven't joined the library since I was quite small! The book was part of a display on for March 8, International Womens' Day. The photograhic accompaniment in the libary featured two women from the republican movement in the north.

#### A Year with Swollen Appendices - Brian Eno

When this first came out, 25 years ago, I didn't 'get' Eno and was quite argumentatively dismissive. I wasn't even young and stupid then, just stupid. In the last ten years or so I have been a little obsessed with Eno's work, so it's time to revisit this.

#### Notes of a Native Son - James Baldwin

The short stories to follow the previous Go Tell It on The Mountain.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/0241334004.jpg" width="300">

#### Collected Stories - Vladimir Nabokov

Another dip-in-and-out short story collection. I have to read it in little bits, otherwise I get overwhelmed by the beauty of the language, and the little vignettes of minor characters, created on a whim and then disposed again.

#### Bestiary - Julio Cortázar

Another big collection of short stories that I'm dipping into and out of for about a year now.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9781784875855-uk.jpg" width="300">

#### A Manual for Cleaning Women - Lucia Berlin

Took me a few years to find this, after endlessly seeing on those lists of 'Important Writers.' A wide ride of interlinked stories, recurring characters, and a notion that it's not really fiction.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9781529077223.jpg" width="300">

#### Dubliners - James Joyce

An annual reread, always a joy over Christmas, always something new. The master.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9780141182452.jpg" width="300">

#### Waiting for Godot - Samuel  Beckett

I've probably seen this play more than any other, but time to reread the text.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/32249589279.jpg" width="300">

#### Un Llarg Hivern - Colm Tóibín

Most of what I'm reading in Catalan these days is from our local global Irish writer just up the valley.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/llarg-hivern-coberta.png" width="300">

#### Girl in a Band - Kim Gordon

If she's not the coolest female bass player called 'Kim' of all time, then she's in the top two. One of the best music books I've read.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/kimgordon.jpg" width="300">

#### Rememberings - Sinéad O'Connor

Oh Sinéad. Some days I want to talk all day about Sinéad and what she means, but then I can't formulate a single sentence.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/sinead.jpg" width="300">

#### Un casa al Pallars - Colm Tóibín

Tóibín, of this parish, has this Joycean knack of making the local be the universal.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9788412835885_1_l.jpg" width="300">

#### Shallow Time: The Burren - Tom Cookson

A philosophical meandering hung around descriptions of the Couny Clare limestone landscape.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/burren.jpg" width="300">

#### Go Tell It on the Mountain - James Baldwin

Another one I read because it kept coming up on those lists of Important Books. And, unsurprisingly, it's quite brilliant, even for someone with no patience for things religious.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/gotell.jpg" width="300">

#### Anna Karenina - Leo Tolstoy

It's been about 35 years since I read this and then lost myself for years in the fiction of Lev Nikolayevich - time for a reread.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9781853262715.jpg" width="300">

#### Invisible Wonen - Caroline Criado Pérez

Data-heavy excoriation of how women are made systematically invisible in the world, where maleness is the default.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/Invisible_Women.jpg" width="300">

#### Lying for Unity - Michael Strubell

Commentary on the work of the Spanish deep state in undermining the Catalan independence movement.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/61UIUO5mLyL._SL1001_.jpg" width="300">

#### Wild Houses - Colin Barrett

A novel that reads like a long version of one of his short story collections.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9780224101660-uk.jpg" width="300">

#### Long Island - Colm Tóibín

The sequel to Brooklyn and just as page-turningly good.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/9781035029457_5638833254.jpg" width="300">

#### Hagstone - Sinéad Gleeson

Long-awaited second book from the inimitable Sinéad, after her 'pain' memoir Constellations.

<img src="/img/tsundoku/hagstone.jpg" width="300">

#### Aesop's Fables

I'm going through this looking for little stories to tell the children.
