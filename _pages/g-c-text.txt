^ The milky water of the Little Colorado at its confluence with the main river. The sediments in the joining stream change the chemical makeup of the river from this point onwards. One consequence is that there are no fish to be found downstream of here. Last chance for a fish supper.

^ Hugh poses shirtless in the tunnel to the suspension bridge at Phantom Ranch. This is the halfway point, about a week in. From here it is possible to hike out.

^ Captain Sideways 'steers' his raft through a rapid as Karen, on lookout, fears for the direction they are taking. Her fears would prove to be well founded before the trip was out.[color=#FF6600]Karen and Donnie[/color]"

^ Kipper catches a surf on the way down somewhere. Longer flat-hulled boats are the weapon of choice for the shallow waves on the river. Shorter playboats can't catch them, and they're a pig to paddle for all the flatwater.[color=#FF6600]Kipper surfs[/color]

^ There were plenty of interesting side-hikes up little canyons carved in strata out by streams. Beautiful as they are, these places can be lethal as flashfloods from rainfall miles away can rage down in seconds. Not that any of that would put you off exploring.

^ This is the scene at the start point, where the entire contents of the blue bus were loaded on the rafts. Everything for the two week trip is either here or it's not coming.
Here the canyon hasn't begun and there is road access, the last road until the end, 225 miles downstream.

^ This is a fairly typical section of canyon, although the wall colour changes greatly depending on what the rock strata is at that spot. The river meanders constantly and you're always rowing towards a slow bend. It draws you on.

^ Brian and Dearbhail in the evening sunshine.
Once you were off the water, the priority was making camp, getting the fire going, and having dinner. After that it was all about sitting around having a beer and enjoying the sunset.

^ On Lava Rapid, I work to get through the waves. This is the biggest rapid on the river, at the 179 mile mark. It's one of those rapids where you lose your bearings when all the horizon lines show nothing but whitewater. This ended badly for me.

^ All the good kayaking shots are of Kipper, probably because he paddles in a new school style - all vertical paddle action and aggressive forward-leaning posture. The rest of us are old school; we don't do vertical or aggressive.

^ Each rapid begins in the same way - a green tongue funneling down into a wavetrain, with each wave being higher and steeper than the previous one. The trick, more so for rafts rather than kayaks, is to pick your starting spot carefully. I plot my course.

^ Taylor was running the river solo and intending to spend 25 days in the canyon; for a change of pace he elected to hang out with us for a few days. Of necessity, he was travelling light and had no beer. We swapped him some cans in return for some of his, eh, exotic tobacco, for which we found space in one of our cakes.

He's quite the hipster snowboarder, with the bored, louche attitude. All he needs are some baggy snowboard pants around his knees. Well, if he had knees.

^ Angie at the prow, Brian mans the oars, and Hugh rummages for biscuits on a laden raft.
We had four rafts like this one. This one is packed with sleeping pads, a spare set of oars, a stack of personal drybags behind the seat. Buried underneath all that are tables, chairs, food boxes, a toilet, tents, first aid box, and the kitchen sink.

^ The early evening when the sun sets and the moon starts to rise is the time when the canyon really comes into its own. The light changes continually and the shifting hues of the rock colour make the hardship and work all worth it.

^ The bridge at Phantom Ranch is the first sign of human activity after a week of being in the canyon. Meeting other people at the ranger station was an edgy experience. They seemed so loud and overbearing, but also curiously fragrant.

bren0041.jpg

^ The oarsman in each raft sat on top of sleeping pads stacked on iceboxes - this one was a store of fresh fruit and veg. The bottom of the icebox sat on the floor of the raft in constant thermal contact with the river. At the end of the trip, there were still slabs of ice underneath them.
[/color]Fruit and vegetables[/color]

^ The most organised aspect of this trip was the beer. Many things were left to chance, such as learning to raft, cook, and survive in the wild, but the beer logistics had its own spreadsheet from months ahead of time.

^ The old-timer in the centre is a legend of the Grand Canyon. Between professional raft guiding and personal trips, Norbert has probably been down the canyon more times than anyone.
He marked up our guidebook with helpful advice on the best campsites for winter sunshine and where to find firewood. His longest trip was a six-week adventure - as he said himself: &quot;Hey, it was the sixties; none of us had jobs.&quot;

^ We didn't have an orchestra to fit in the huge cave, so we set up a volleyball court instead, using two oars and a safety rope. We played a lot of evening volleyball on this trip.[color=#FF6600]Volleyball in the cave[/color]

^ This is Kevin, Lorna, and I unintentionally running the left channel of Bedrock Rapid, a rapid sometimes called 'Go Right Or Die.'
