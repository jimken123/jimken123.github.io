<p>^ On the first day everyone was busy figuring out how to make the rafts go the way we wanted them to go, specifically, downstream. Not as easy as you might think.</p>

<p>^ The milky water of the Little Colorado at its confluence with the main river. The sediments in the joining stream change the chemical makeup of the river from this point onwards. One consequence is that there are no fish to be found downstream of here. Last chance for a fish supper.</p>

<p>^ Captain Sideways 'steers' his raft through a rapid as Karen, on lookout, fears for the direction they are taking. Her fears would prove to be well founded before the trip was out.[color=#FF6600]Karen and Donnie[/color]</p>

<p>^ Kipper catches a surf on the way down somewhere. Longer flat-hulled boats are the weapon of choice for the shallow waves on the river. Shorter playboats can't catch them, and they're a pig to paddle for all the flatwater.[color=#FF6600]Kipper surfs[/color]</p>

<p>^ There were plenty of interesting side-hikes up little canyons carved in strata out by streams. Beautiful as they are, these places can be lethal as flashfloods from rainfall miles away can rage down in seconds. Not that any of that would put you off exploring.

<p>^ Kipper leans into the oars, while John catches some sleep in a patch of winter sunshine. Rowing the raft was the best way to keep warm.

<p>^ At Phantom Ranch Dearbhail hiked out as she only had so many holiday days to take. That's why Brian is looking glum, presumably. I don't know what's wrong with Hugh though.

<p>^ This is the scene at the start point, where the entire contents of the blue bus were loaded on the rafts. Everything for the two week trip is either here or it's not coming.
Here the canyon hasn't begun and there is road access, the last road until the end, 225 miles downstream.

<p>^ When Captain Sideways flips a raft, he flips it good. It took eight men to right this fully laden raft. Karen has still not completely forgiven Donnie for the quarter-mile swim she took as a result of his helmsmanship.
