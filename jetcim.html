## Jetcim

Port Aine is our local ski station. It's about thirty minutes from our house, so we go up there most weekends in the season. The main chairlift, called Jetcim, takes you from the hotel at the bottom (at 2,000 metres altitude) up to Pic de l'Orri (the tippy top) which is at 2,440 metres. Sometimes we drive up to the top, but Jetcim is the more traditional transport.

Each chairlift seats six and there are 122 of them. I'm adding to this page every time I take a lift I haven't been on yet, beginning in the 2023-2024 season. I don't know how long it will take.
