# Ancient stuff

*I don't wanna, I don't think so.*

I used to be on Twitter, from 2008 to 2022. My archive is backed up here - [/twitter](https://jimken123.github.io/twitter/)

I ran the MananaManana blog from 2008 to 2011. You can find that here - [/mananamanana blog](https://mananamanana.wordpress.com)

I compiled the Scotland Trip Reports from 2004 to 2007 - those are here - [/scotland trip reports](http://www.mananamanana.com/trip_reports.htm)

I commentated on Herbert Park Rangers FC in 2003 - rescued from Geocities here - [/herbert park rangers fc](http://mananamanana.com/hprfc/)
