This is what I have been reading/re-reading in the past while. Dubliners I re-read every year and Catch 22 jumps back off the shelves every decade or so.

With a movie coming out soon on McGahern's That They May Face the Rising Sun I've been oon a bit of a McGahern binge - I didn't realise there is a mini-series of Amongst Women, and I found it on youtube so I'm working through that. I haven't read That They May Face the Rising Sun since it first came out and it seems now that over 20 years have passed since then.
