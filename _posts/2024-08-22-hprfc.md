Next up in the project to recover all the old content is my first foray into web building, the infamous football commentary Geocities website Herbert Park Rangers Football Club, mainly the ~~2004~~2003 season. The football was basically UCD canoe club having kickarounds, usually on  ~~Thursdays~~Tuesdays and sometimes Saturdays, if the rivers weren't running. The website was the vehicle by which I slagged off everyone the following day. Oh what bliss was the internet before commenting was invented! Just my point of view and no right of reply for the readers.

This restored version of HPRFC was salvaged from the [wayback machine](https://archive.org). In the original Geocities version the individual match reports were popup-style windows, so they don't render the same in this new version, but, hey, they exist. The little Subbuteo players used to wobble when you hovered over them, but that early-internet voodoo is now lost too. The club crest featuring Costa Rican Kevin Keegan was created in MS Paint (MS Paint 4EVA!) and the club motto was 'You'll Never Walk Again'.

All the HPRFC content can now be found on [hprfc.mananamanana.com](https://hprfc.mananamanana.com), including such highlights as the ever-changing stadium name, KP inducted into the Hall of Fame, guest editor Liz, that 50/50 ball where I broken Donnacha's jaw and he had to drink soup for a month, all the Chinese guys called Sean, and impeaching the committee. Good times, good times.
