Up until today, the pages on my #jekyll website were of the form example.com/foo, that is, stored at root. The top-level of the repo was starting to look messy with a load of pages, so I decided to investigate moving them inside a folder, just for tidyiness.

Fast-forward an hour of so, and now the config file is configured, the markdown files have evenmoar head metadata (or whatever it's called), and the files are stored in a /_pages folder.

Everything displays exactly as before - example.com/foo, although stored in example.com/_pages/foo - still shows up as example.com/foo. 

To the end-user (hi mam!) there's no difference, and my OH asks if I spent the morning 'dicking around with my website.' I have posted no new blogposts, that is to say, actual content, since, like, September last year. 

So if anyone ever asks you what exactly is the philosopy of the #smallweb, well, now you know.
