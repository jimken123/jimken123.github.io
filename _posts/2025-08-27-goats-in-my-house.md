There are goats in my house and I can't hide, to misquote The Fall.

Everything displays exactly as before - example.com/foo, although stored in example.com/_pages/foo - still shows up as example.com/foo. 

To the end-user (hi mam!) there's no difference, and my OH asks if I spent the morning 'dicking around with my website.' I have posted no new blogposts, that is to say, actual content, since, like, September last year. 

So if anyone ever asks you what exactly is the philosopy of the #smallweb, well, now you know.
