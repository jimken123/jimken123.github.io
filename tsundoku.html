## Tsundoku

The Japanese concept of *tsundoku* is the phenomeneon of acquiring books but letting them pile up without reading them. It's a portmanteau of two Japanese words meaning "to pile things up ready for later and leave" and "reading books."

The term is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf. In the West it has a negative connotation of a hoarding mania with no realistic expectation of getting around to reading the books.

I'm choosing to use the more optimistic interpretation of "books are good, there's no such thing as too many" and "I'm definitely more likely to read them if I have them on my bookshelf."

### My year in books

This is what I'm reading at the moment, have piled up to read in the future, or have read in the recent past. I'll keep adding to the list of what I've read.
