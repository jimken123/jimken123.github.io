### mananamanana.com

mananamanana.com is an accumulation of all my flotsam and jetsam from over the two decades of being present on the world wide web. It's now an impenetrable jungle of html fragments, glitchy css, badly named files, and a Gordian knot of intermeshed folders of image files.

It has been on the go since March 2005, waaaay back in the day. It was preceded by my first foray into the world of web building on geocities, where I 'blogged' our rolling, endless games of football in Herbert Park in Dublin.

This new look is a long overdue revamp, inspired by the ideas of the small web, the movement to claim back our corners of the internet. This overhaul, the first major one in twenty years, is, naturally, a work in progress. I'm trying to find and retrieve all my stuff, as much of it that still exists somewhere. To wit, I've been elbow-deep in archive.org, rooting around in dusty folders on desktops, and unzipping ancient zip files.

The nu-blog now added to this pile is an attempt to get back to the roots of the old web - a personal record of whatever the fuck I feel like discussing. 

Separately I maintain the ohpiglet blog related to my three monkeys and my woodland creature of the forest floor. That more proper blog is all about my children.

I am a fan of the Oxford comma, the stoic Mexican burro above, and juxtaposing the letters 'n' and 'g' when typign.
